# colony_screening

The 96WP_colony_screening macro is designed to use ImageJ to screen 96-well plates for the presence of colonies after clonal isolation. The macro takes a folder with stitched images of wells as an input and identifies wells containing colonies of adhered cells. The macro generates a TIFF file containing the images of the segmented colonies, and a CSV file summarizing the positive/negative calls for each well.
